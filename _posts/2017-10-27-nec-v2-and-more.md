# NEC, Screenly V2 Player and more

## Screenly partners with NEC

We are very excited to announce that Screenly recently [partnered with NEC](https://www.nec-display-solutions.com/p/hq/en/news/dp/Products/Shared/News/2017/PressReleases/Products/LFD/Ubuntu/Ubuntu.xhtml) to deliver Screenly Pro to NEC's P and V series monitors. What makes this unique is the fact that as the first major display manufacturer, NEC has chosen to embed a custom Raspberry Pi Compute Module into its monitors. This means that you can run Screenly Pro directly on this monitor with no additional hardware. This brings the best both worlds: a high quality display with the most innovative digital signage solution out there.

If you're interested in learning more about this, please visit our [NEC page](https://www.screenly.io/nec/).

## Screenly at NEC Nordic Showcase

As part of the partnership with NEC, we were invited to NEC Nordic Showcase in Gothenburg, Sweden. At the event, we showed how Screenly Pro works seamlessly on NEC V and P series monitors. We had lots of interesting conversations with both partners and large companies. This was our first event in the Nordics and we are now working with both partners and clients to roll out our first proof-of-concept deployments there. Exciting times!

## Screenly v2 player is now in public beta

We were overwhelmed by the amount of interest in our Screenly v2 beta sign-up. Hundreds of companies signed up. While we still have some work on the v2 release, we have made significant enough progress that we now want to invite a larger audience of testers to the beta.

You can read more about the current status of the beta version [here](https://support.screenly.io/hc/en-us/articles/115001603993-Screenly-Pro-V2-Beta-Player-information).

Once the new player becomes the default player, we will start sunsetting the old version over the course of 6-12 months. After that point, we will no longer support the old version. There is no need to panic though. No action is required today, there's still plenty of time and we will provide every existing customer with a simple upgrade path well ahead of time.

If you'd like to get the beta ahead of time you can get the new image right now:

## What IoT can bring to digital signage in retail?

We recently wrote a guest post together with our friends at [EVRYTHNG](https://evrythng.com/) about how Internet of Things (IoT) can improve digital signage in a retail environment. In short, we believe that the future of digital signage in retail is all about [Reactive Digital Signage](https://www.screenly.io/digital-signage-meets-iot/). What this means is that the content will change depending on external variables. This can be anything from the weather to sensors.

## New case study: Cinema

![Screenly running at Cinergy]({% asset_path "blog/cinergy_case_study.png" %})

In the next few months, we are planning to create more case studies. Our first case study was developed together with Ubuntu and it targeted the digital signage in cinemas and movie theaters. It explores what is unique about this particular environment and how our customer Cinergy was able to save a large amount of money by switching to Screenly.

You can find the case study [here](https://www.screenly.io/use-cases/cinemas/).

Are you doing something interesting with Screenly Pro? [Let us know](https://support.screenly.io) and perhaps we can do a case study about you too.

## New video: A quick introduction to Screenly Pro's web interface

If you're still new to Screenly Pro, you may want to take a look at our crash course in Screenly Pro's web interface.

## Screenly OSE 0.12 is out

While this newsletter mostly focuses on Screenly Pro, this doesn't mean that we have left Screenly OSE behind. On the contrary. We are deeply committed to maintaining and improving Screenly OSE. While it might not have all the bells and whistles of Screenly Pro (we need to pay our bills and staff after all), we are still actively working on improving Screenly OSE.

The latest release of Screenly OSE can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Screenly/screenly-ose/releases) and from [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/). It includes changes such as:

 * Improved API documentation
 * Migration to Flask (back-end change)
 * Support for Raspbian Stretch
 * Various bug fixes

You can find more detail about the release [here](https://www.screenly.io/blog/2017/10/26/screenly-ose-0-12-is-out/)

In the next sprint (release), we will be working on things like [Resin](https://www.resin.io) support, and improving our API. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/Screenly/screenly-ose/milestone/7).

## Are you interested in a queue management system?

You know those paper numbers you get in stores that you hold on to while waiting for your turn? Those systems are called queue management systems. We looked at this market and noticed that there was no real good open source solution on the market for this (but loads of commercial solutions). Since it ties into digital signage, we are exploring if there is demand for an open source version of this.

If you are interested in this, please fill out [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/LokZ8vI5AgkqfFGy1).

## We're hiring!

Last, but not least, we're looking for a [Jr Sales Executive](https://angel.co/screenly/jobs/286654-jr-sales-executive). If you want to be part of shaping the future of digital signage, apply [here](https://goo.gl/forms/ENSFfaroAYQczhys2).

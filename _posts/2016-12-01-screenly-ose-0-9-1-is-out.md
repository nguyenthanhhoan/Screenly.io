# Screenly OSE 0.9.1 is out

![]({% asset_path "blog/screenly-ose-0.9.1-is-out.png" %})

We’re excited to announce that [Screenly OSE](https://www.screenly.io/ose/) 0.9.1 now is out. The release includes everything from [Sprint 1](https://github.com/wireload/screenly-ose/milestone/3?closed=1) (codename [It’s so Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUwW7RI3U0w)), which in turn includes a number of bug fixes and improved tests (to minimize the chance of future bugs).

To update your existing player, simply run:
$ bash <(curl -sL https://www.screenly.io/install-ose.sh)

For new installations, you can download the latest disk images [from Github](https://github.com/wireload/screenly-ose/releases/tag/v0.9.1).

In the the [next sprint](https://github.com/wireload/screenly-ose/milestone/4) (codename [Night Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyf8oRF6Trg)), we intend to add a number of exciting features, such as supporting basic auth in web pages.

(If you haven’t noticed, each sprint is named after a Guns N’ Roses song. In Screenly OSE, we are working our way forward through their discography starting with [Appetite for Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite_for_Destruction). In [Screenly Pro](https://www.screenly.io), we are working our way through the Iron Maiden discography.)

**Update:** Screenly OSE 0.10 is now out Learn more about it [here](https://news.screenly.io/screenly-ose-0-10-is-out-a34978d98a54).

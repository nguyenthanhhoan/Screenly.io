# Screenly September Update

New look, features improved billing and more.

Here’s an update from Screenly. Lots of things have happened since the last update, but we’ll try to sum it up in this post.

## New email design

As part of our effort to constantly improve, we’ve brought on a new team member to lead our design overhaul. We will, in the near future, start to improve the look and feel of all our user elements. First out was our email templates. Soon we will be rolling out updates to other elements too.

## New feature: add assets in batches

We take much pride in the way our playlist system works. However, there is always room for improvement. One thing that we’ve heard many of you ask for is to make it easier and faster to add multiple assets to a playlist. We listened and we are happy to announce that it is now possible to add multiple assets to the same playlist without leaving the asset popover.

## Upcoming change: improved billing

Some of you have been a bit confused over the way we do billing for extra screens (i.e. screens exceeding the included number in your plan). The way it currently works is that we will charge your regular plan at the beginning of the month, but we charge you retroactively for extra screens based on the maximum number of screens during the billing cycle.

Going forward, we will now make this process easier and more clear. When you add a new screen that exceeds the limit of your plan, you will be asked to confirm that you want to increase your limit and your billing will be adjusted accordingly right away.

This will ensure that there will never be any unexpected extra screen charges, as you will be explicitly prompted at the time of adding the screen.

## Screenly will become Screenly, Inc

Screenly was born out of [WireLoad](https://www.wireload.net), which a software incubator. However, with the success Screenly has seen in the last year, it’s now time to graduate Screenly out of WireLoad and make it into its own company.

For all intents and purposes, nothing will change for you as a user. The only thing that will change is that you will see ‘Screenly, Inc’ on your invoices instead of ‘Screenly by WireLoad, Inc’.

## Screenlyapp.com is now Screenly.io

As some of you may have noticed, we have moved our website to a new domain: [Screenly.io](https://www.screenly.io). It’s a shorter and easier to remember URL, and a part of our new marketing initiative. In a not too distant future, we will start making improvements to the design of the website.

Please note that the actual web interface for interacting with your Screenly devices remains on screenlyapp.com.

## New support portal

As part of our domain migration to Screenly.io, we have also migrated our support to [support.screenly.io](https://support.screenly.io). We’ve also migrated our FAQ entries over to this web property in order to make the documentation more closely tied to our support desk.

Going forward, we will merge the login between our support portal and our regular interface. This way you will not need to keep two separate logins, but rather be able to use your Screenly login to access our support.

## What do you think of Screenly?

We are always looking to learn more about our users. We would very much appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to fill out this [quick survey](https://survey.io/survey/19ecb). We promise that it won’t take long.

## New partner: Nexudus

We’re excited to announce our latest parter, [Nexudus](http://www.nexudus.com/). For those of you not familiar with Nexudus, they are the leading platform for managing coworking spaces, powering the back office of a large number of coworking spaces and shared offices around the world.

With our integration with Nexudus, we allow customers to display data directly from Nexudus directly on the screen. For instance, you can display the conference bookings directly on a Screenly powered device.

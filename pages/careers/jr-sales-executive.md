# Junior Sales Executive

## About the role

We’re looking for an energetic and hungry inside sales person to join our rapidly growing startup, currently making waves in the Digital Signage market. You will be the primary point of contact for customers and apply best in class sales skills to develop and nurture a pipeline of customer opportunities through to closure. Our team is geographically distributed, and you will be working with smart people from around the globe.

## Responsibilities

* You will spend a lot of time communicating with existing customers to establish relationships with them to help enable them grow.
* You will qualify and manage an inbound pipeline of leads with the aim of   converting them into paying customers.
* You will provide guidance to customers and organise remote demos of Screenly Digital Signage services.
* You will hunt for new business through the use of outbound email, messaging platforms and telephone calls to grow your pipeline of leads.

## Perks

* You work remotely. If that’s from your home office, your couch or in Thailand that’s up to you. As long as you perform and achieve your sales targets, we have no preference. You can learn more about how we work [here]({{ site.url}}/blog/2016/11/23/how-we-work-at-screenly/).
* You set your own hours (within reason) but you are responsible to meet your target earnings.
* You will receive one-on-one coaching/mentoring from a senior sales executive.
* There’s plenty of room for growth in this young and dynamic startup.

## About you

* You’re fluent in English (written and spoken). Additional languages would be considered a plus.
* You need to be ambitious and hardworking. The company is growing fast and this can quickly progress your sales career.
* You have a proven track record of over achieving sales targets.
* You’re tech savvy and love to learn about new technologies and tools. You don’t need to be a coder per se (even thought that would be a plus), but you have good understanding of tech at large and can learn quickly.
* You are familiar with working with CRM tools to track leads and deal flow.
* You’re a self-starter and know how to figure things out for yourself without detailed instructions and hand holding.
* You have great attention to detail, things like poorly aligned images in a slide deck (or god forbid, non-transparent images) drives you crazy.

**Pay:** $20,000 + commission

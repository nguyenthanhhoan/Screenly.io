# Digital Signage for gyms

As a business owner, regardless of which industry you're in - you've heard by now that [content is king](https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2017/06/21/why-content-will-always-always-king/#6bc2b227eb37). For gyms where customers take themselves to your physical premises, content doesn't have to reside only in the [virtual](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-content-strategy/) world. So why not make use of screens?

## How gyms can utilize displays

### The marketing impact of digital signage solutions

As human beings, we are visually-oriented and inherently [disinclined](http://uk.businessinsider.com/new-years-resolutions-courses-2016-12?international=true&r=UK&IR=T) to keep our New Year's resolutions. Use these tendencies to figure out what type of content cater well to your gym members. Give your members a motivational nudge with visual content. How about local success stories? Transformation testimonials are huge in the fitness industry.

On a more practical level, assist their daily progress by flashing well-being tips. Don't rely on their sheer willpower to keep them in your gym; trigger them to keep coming back. Garnering a herd of [devoted](https://uhurunetwork.com/gym-member-retention-customer-service/) customers is a financially [lucrative](http://www.bain.com/Images/BB_Prescription_cutting_costs.pdf) strategy that even contributes to organic marketing (a.k.a customer [retention](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers)).

Screenly's digital signage solution is ideal for [advertising](https://www.screenly.io/use-cases/retail/). But unlike the hurdle conventional ads have to overcome, your target audience doesn't have much else vying for their attention. Gym members are naturally more inclined to the products you market and as an audience, more prone to pay attention to your messages and displayed content.

Since they have already committed the time to spend at the gym, you aren't stealing their time but rather, assisting them with their pursuits: to improve their workouts. Your screens can provide practical info geared towards gym users' convenience, such as

* Announcements
* Information about courses
* Training schedules
* Room occupancy statuses

Or even promotional content to enhance their time at the gym (plus boost sales for your business):

* Wellness programs
* Special club offers or loyalty programs
* Cafeteria [menu board](https://www.screenly.io/use-cases/restaurants/) (new items, daily specials, etc.)
* Exposure/ads for personal trainers

Trainers will benefit from an increase in their clients, as will the gym's business overall. Clients committed to personal training are more likely to renew their gym memberships. Neither this list nor the benefits of these items are comprehensive, but you get the idea.

### Displays don't have to be special to have impact

If your gym is like most others that can't spare the energy to churn out original content, curate content for infotainment. Tap into your gym members' interests, both general and specific, to provide them with relevant info. For starters, such content may be:

* Live sports matches
* Health news
* Localized live data
* Traffic status
* [Weather](https://www.screenly.io/blog/2017/07/27/introducing-the-screenly-app-store/) forecasts
* Pollen index
* Vendor ads to earn advertising subsidies (for any fitness-related products or services)

Fair enough if you still think these are merely additional expenses you aren't ready to jump into. We could preach about digital signage being a worthy investment, but actually have an even stronger case: not only for why you should get displays now, but also how you indeed, can with Screenly.

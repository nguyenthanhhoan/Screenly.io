# Digital signage for modern art installations
The fluid, progressive realm of modern art has been one of the prompt [embracers](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/08/electric-dreams-modern-technology-art-world) of technology. Once a groundbreaking subject, the [intersection](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/7-ways-technology-is-changing-how-art-is-made-180952472/) of art and tech is now continually explored as a topic that’s [here to stay](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/29/rebooting-the-relationship-between-art-and-tech).

## Creating art doesn't have to be a pricey feat
Art can be beyond costly. But with the advent of technology, art has joined numerous other fields that now enjoy lowered thresholds of entry. Like the influx of individual bloggers publishing content, or vloggers’ rise to fame via YouTube videos, art too is no longer bound by daunting financial prerequisites.

Lowering materialistic hurdles sounds ideal, but has it truly been achieved across sectors? We don’t think so - at least not in the [digital signage market](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/01/11/905042/0/en/Digital-Signage-Market-size-to-exceed-23bn-by-2023-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html).

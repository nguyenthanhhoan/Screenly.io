# Digital Signage for Elevators

It is becoming increasingly common for elevators to be equipped with screens that show various form of advertisement. Content in these screens range from advertising, to lunch menus to internal information. What makes signage in elevators really effective is that you truly have a captive audience. In most elevators, there is no cellphone reception. This means that for a few rare minutes people look up from their mobile devices. This is your opportunity to engage with them.

## The problem

Getting the screens installed into the elevator is just the start. Now you need to manage the content on these screens. A common "solution" for content management in elevators boils down to rotating around USB sticks or SD cards to propagate your content around the screens. This of course is not ideal. It might work if you only manage one elevator, and only need to update the content once a month, but what if you manage 15 elevators and need to be able to quickly update content?

## The solution

Enter Screenly. Because Screenly uses the Raspberry Pi as the player, it has a very small footprint both in terms of power consumption and size. This means that you can easily fit it into even small spaces, like an elevator. Moreover, most elevator monitors do have HDMI input, which means that you can retrofit an existing solution with Screenly.

In some elevator cabs, you only have internet connection (WiFi or wired) when the elevator is in "sleep mode," while in other elevators you have constant internet connection. While you do need internet connection during parts of the day to use Screenly, our system is designed to survive internet outages during part of the day.

Once you have connected the players and configured them to Screenly, you're able to instantly manage content across all your screens. You can group the elevators into logical groups and schedule content accordingly. You can check out our [crash course video](https://youtu.be/LVMQMHci6DI) that takes you through the basics of Screenly Pro's simple, yet powerful, web interface.

## Use case

One of the most impressive deployments that we have seen of Screenly is in the Merchandise Mart, an iconic building in downtown Chicago. In these glorious elevators, there are hidden screens that show a slideshow of historical images from the building and surrounding area.

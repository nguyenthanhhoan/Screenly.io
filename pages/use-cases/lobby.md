# Digital Signage in Lobbies

If done right, putting up signs in the lobby of your company can improve the experience of visitors. The key here is done right. There are a number of pitfalls that you should avoid. Let's explore the unique challenges of digital signage in lobbies.

## Video walls

It's fairly common to see video wall installations in lobbies. There are a number of jaw-dropping installations around the world. What's rarely discussed however is the cost of both content and hardware for such installations.

If you're not swimming in cash, then you likely do care about these factors. Luckily, there is a solution for this. With Screenly you can create a [cost effective video wall]({{ site.url }}/blog/2017/09/05/create-a-cost-effective-digital-signage-video-wall-with-screenly/).

Not only does our approach use cost effective hardware, but it also allows you to use regular 1080p content, instead of having to create custom (read expensive) content that is unique to these video wall installations.

## Keep it simple

It's too common to see screens overloaded with content. Don't fall for the argument that having more content on screens is better. Stick to your key message. This is particularly important for a lobby installation. You want to make an positive impression on your visitors. The best way to do that is to keep the content elegant and simple. Less is more. If visitors want to check the news, weather or stocks, their smartphone is far more suited for that.

Instead, show things like:

 * Products that you want to highlight
 * Company background and performance
 * Interesting facts about the company

Depending on the nature of your business, it might also be a good idea to greet your visitors with their logo on the screens. This can be done easily using just a template.

## Budget for content

As mentioned above, creating content can be expensive if you use a custom video wall configuration. However, with Screenly, we use regular 1080p content. This doesn't have to be very expensive to produce. Moreover, you can save a lot of money by using Screenly (both in terms of licensing and hardware), so put some of that money into design. That will make you look a lot more professional.

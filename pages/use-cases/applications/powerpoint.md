*A quick screencast on how to create content for Screenly using PowerPoint*

Microsoft PowerPoint is likely the most popular presentation software on the market. For a lot of users, it is not only the go-to tool for presentations, but also for creating charts and illustrations for their business cases.

Because of this widespread use of PowerPoint, we have received a lot of requests on how to use PowerPoint with Screenly. However, due to the proprietary nature of Microsoft PowerPoint files, there is no way for us to natively support displaying these files.

We do however recommend one of the following workarounds.

Before you begin, we recommend that you [change the resolution](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/827745) of your slide deck to 1920x1080 pixels, which is the resolution Screenly uses.

## Export your slide deck as images

Perhaps the easiest way to use your PowerPoint deck in Screenly is to simply export your slide deck as images.

More information on how to export your slide deck to images, please see [this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/827745) article.

Once you have your presentation exported as images, you can just add them all as assets in Screenly.

## Export your slide deck as a video

Another way of of using PowerPoint presentations with Screenly is to export it as a video. Details on how to do that can be found [here](https://support.office.com/en-au/article/Turn-your-presentation-into-a-video-c140551f-cb37-4818-b5d4-3e30815c3e83).

With the video exported, just add it as an asset in Screenly.

Please note that if you are using [Screenly OSE]({{site.url}}/ose/), you will likely need to re-encode the video such that it uses a supported video codec. For [Screenly Pro](https://login.screenlyapp.com/signup) on the other hand, this re-encoding will happen automatically.

## Upload your slide deck to Google Slides

Lastly, you may want to use Google Slides (which is a part of [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)) with Screenly. To use Google Slides with Screenly, simply follow these steps:

 * Upload your PowerPoint presentation to Google Slides.
 * Verify that everything looks fine.
 * Go to *'File'* -> *'Publish to the web...'*.
 * In the dialogue box that appears, select the desired duration for each slide and copy the URL.
 * Add the URL in Screenly as an asset. Make sure to set the duration to be as long as the total duration of the slides in the set.

# Your digital menu board

## Powerful scheduling

Out-of-the-box, Screenly comes with a [sophisticated playlist component](http://wireload.net/news/2014/10/sophisticated_new_playlist_editor_in_screenly.html) that is ideal for restaurants. Chances are you have different offering for different times of the day. Maybe you have a breakfast, lunch and a dinner menu. Perhaps you even have a special weekend menu and a happy hour menu. You don't want to display your dinner menu during the lunch rush.

With Screenly, you can create playlists for all of this. All you need to do is to tell the system when to play what, and Screenly will take care of the rest.

Got restaurants in different timezones? Not a problem. You can set the timezone per device.

## Easy to manage

Screenly's intuitive user interface makes it trivial for even non-technical users to manage playlists. All you need to do is to upload your menus and schedule them accordingly. If you have many screens, you can chose to manage them all to gether, or break them into different group and use different content.


## Cost effective

The hardware that Screenly runs on is called a Raspberry Pi. You can purchase one of these units for about $60 with all the components included from on of our [distributors]({{site.url}}/distributors/). All you need to do is to plug it into the wall and you're ready to go.

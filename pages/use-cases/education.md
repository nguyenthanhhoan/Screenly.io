# Info screens in education

More and more schools and universities are starting to discover the benefits of digital info screens. It is a quick and cost effective way to make information available to both the staff and student body. No matter if it is a seasonal greeting, an event schedule or general announcements, digital signage can help you and your staff improve communication.

## Why Screenly?

When first exploring the concept of using info screens, many schools and univiersities tend to begin with home built solutions based on regular PCs and a regular web browser. While that is likely to quickly get you off the ground, managing it is time consuming work.

### Simple interface

Screenly comes with a playlist manager built-in, which allows you to easily manaage one screen, or a fleet of screens. As such, there is no need to connect a keyboard and mouse (or open a VNC session) every time you want to make a change.

### Cost effective

Screenly runs on a hardware platform called Raspberry Pi. You can purchase one of these units for about $60 with all the components included from one of our [distributors]({{site.url}}/distributors/). All you need to do is to plug the device into the wall and you're ready to go.

### Painless management

Another strenght of Screenly is that it is a set-and-forget device. Most other hardware alternatives will require you to schedule and manage updates. Our guess is that you have more important things to do than running around the school updating the devices.

# Your dashboard device

![Dashboard]({% asset_path "dashboard.png" %})

In the modern company, decisions are made based on data, not gut feelings. Yet, without making this data readily available it's hard to put it to use. This is where dashboards come into play.

With Screenly it's both cost effective and easy to manage these dashboards. This enables you quickly deploy screens for your various teams without breaking the bank.

Thanks to the powerful management interface in Screenly, you can manage all your dashboards in the same system and easily add and remove dashboards. Also, since Screenly supports displaying regular web pages, you can easily use your existing dashboards. Out-of-the-box, Screenly can be used to display data from:

 * [Chartbeat]({{site.url}}/use-cases/dashboard/chartbeat/)
 * [Geckoboard]({{site.url}}/use-cases/dashboard/geckoboard/)
 * [Google Calendar]({{site.url}}/use-cases/dashboard/google-calendar/)
 * Grafana
 * Graphite
 * [HostedGraphite]({{site.url}}/use-cases/dashboard/hostedgraphite/)
 * Leftronic
 * [Munin]({{site.url}}/use-cases/dashboard/munin/)
 * [Nagios]({{site.url}}/use-cases/dashboard/nagios/)
 * [New Relic]({{site.url}}/use-cases/dashboard/newrelic/)

## Why Screenly?

When first exploring the concept of using dashboards, many companies purchase PCs, Mac Minis or even Chromeboxes. While that is likely to quickly get you off the ground by simply pointing the built-in browser to your dashboard, it soon becomes a nightmare to manage.

### Built-in asset management

Chances are that you have more than one dashboard that you want to display per screen and cycle through. Screenly comes with that built-in and you can easily add a new dashboard and deploy it to one or more of your screens. You don't need to connect a keyboard and mouse (or open a VNC session) every time you want to make a change.

### Cost effective

The hardware that Screenly runs on is called a Raspberry Pi. Pre-configured devices can be purchased for about $60 with all the components included from one of our [distributors]({{site.url}}/distributors/). All you need to do is to plug it into the wall and you're ready to go. That's a steal compared to a Mac Mini.

### Managed updates

Another strength of Screenly is that it is a set-and-forget device. Most other hardware alternatives will require you to schedule and manage updates. Our guess is that you have more important things to do than running around the office updating the dashboard devices.


### Security

Screenly was designed from the start with security in mind. Far too often do we see compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices due poor security practice from the vendors. We take security seriously and we want to make sure that you can rely on us.

# Digital signage software for coworking spaces and shared offices

*Office greeting screens powered by Screenly with data provided by Nexudus at a co-working space in New York.*

Co-working spaces or shared offices, like WeWork, is a rapidly growing market. Many of these offices relies heavily on digital signage in order to communicate messages as well as provide visitors and tenants with helpful information.

Behind the scenes, a large number of these offices are using a software called [Nexudus](http://www.nexudus.com/) to manage everything from billings to bookings of conference rooms. This is why we teamed up with Nexudus to provide custom digital signage for coworking spaces.

Thanks to our integration, co-working spaces are able to re-use the data that already exists in Nexudus on their screens. With this data, we have designed two different kinds of unique signs: meeting room sign and office greeting screens.

### Meeting room signs

Many office spaces are using Nexudus booking functionality to manage availability in their meeting rooms or shared areas. We have written a custom integration in Screenly that allows us to extract this data from Nexudus and render this data in the form of a calendar.  All we need to do is to configure the screen and point it to what room it is in Nexudus, and the screen will display the data automatically.

This data could either be displayed using a 7” touch screen that can be mounted just by the entrance, or on a larger screen.

### Office greeting screens
When a new tenant moves into an office, you want to make them feel like home. They take pride in their company and want to show it off to the world, including guests and other tenants.

In some coworking spaces, big stickers with the company’s logo decorate the outside wall. Other coworking space only uses office room numbers and prevent companies from putting up too much branding to make it easier to turn over the rooms.

We think there is a better way. By putting up a small screen outside each office, we’re able to give the companies the branding they want, fully with their logo and a slogan. Moreover, with our Nexudus integration, we can do this seamlessly. Just add this data Nexudus, and the screen will automatically update.

Later on, when the company moves to a bigger office and a new tenant moves in, the screen will automatically update eliminating the need for removing old stickers and printing new ones.

### Messaging
In addition to these custom screens, regular digital signage displays can be added for messaging using the same platform running on regular TVs.  Screenly support videos, web pages, and images, so you can truly create compelling messages for your co-working space.

## The hardware
Screenly runs on the famous Raspberry Pi, and is the leading digital signage platform for said platform powering over 10,000 screens around the world. This little $35 computer is sufficient to drive both small and large screens while providing a fantastic user experience.

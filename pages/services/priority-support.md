# Screenly Priority Support

Different customers have different needs. For some organizations, their digital signage deployments are merely 'nice to have', while for others they are mission critical.

For customers where their digital signage plays a critical role in their organization, we are happy to offer Screenly Priority Support.

The Priority Support option gives you the following:

 * 24/7 phone support
 * Priority for support tickets with at most 24 hours to initial response (weekdays).
 * Faster escalation path to engineers

The plan gives you three calls per month, and provides you with the best possible response time.

**9.2** The receiving party (“Receiving Party”) of any Confidential Information may use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of furtherance of the business relationship between the parties (if applicable), as provided in the TOS and the Privacy Policy, and shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, other than to employees of the Receiving Party who have a need to have access to and knowledge of the Confidential Information, solely for the purpose(s) authorized above, unless written or electronic permission is granted by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party as provided in the TOS and the Privacy Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when Screenly is the Receiving Party, it may disclose Confidential Information to any employee or contractor of Screenly or Screenly’s directly and indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries having a need within his or her authorized scope of employment to have access to or knowledge of the Confidential Information. Each party shall take appropriate measures by instruction and agreement prior to disclosure to such employees to assure against unauthorized use or disclosure.

**9.3** The Receiving Party shall have no obligation with respect to information that i) was rightfully in possession of the Receiving Party without any obligation of confidentiality prior to receiving it from the Disclosing Party; ii) is, or subsequently becomes, legally and publicly available without breach of the TOS; iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a source other than the Disclosing Party without any obligation of confidentiality; iv) is developed by or for the Receiving Party without use of the Confidential Information and such independent development can be shown by documentary evidence; or v) is disclosed by the Receiving Party pursuant to and in accordance with a valid order issued by a court or government agency, provided that the Receiving Party provides a) prior written notice to the Disclosing Party of such order and b) the Disclosing Party prior opportunity to oppose or restrict such disclosure. Upon written demand by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall: i) cease using the Confidential Information, ii) return the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to the Disclosing Party within seven (7) days of receipt of demand except where transfer and/or storage capabilities mandate a different time frame, and iii) upon request of the Disclosing Party, certify in writing that the Receiving Party has complied with the obligations set forth in this paragraph.

**9.4** Each party shall retain all right, title and interest to such party’s Confidential Information. No license to any intellectual property (or application for intellectual property protection) is either granted or implied by the conveying of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall not reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any software, methods, systems, devices, apparatuses or other utility elements disclosed to it and shall not remove, overprint or deface any notice of copyright or confidentiality, trademark, trade-secret, logo, legend, or other notices of ownership from any originals or copies of Confidential Information it obtains from the Disclosing Party or from any copies the Disclosing Party is authorized to make.

Any press release, publication, advertisement or public disclosure regarding these TOS is subject to both the prior review and the written approval of both parties.


## 10. TERM AND TERMINATION

**10.1** The TOS shall commence on the Effective Date and continue thereafter for a period of one year, unless sooner terminated, as set forth below. The TOS shall be automatically renewed thereafter, for successive one (1) year periods, unless at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date of any such renewal, either party shall have given written notice to the other of its intention that the TOS not be renewed. The TOS shall automatically terminate at the end of the annual period during which such notice is given. Upon termination of the TOS or in any other instance where Customer does not agree to abide by the TOS, Customer shall cease to have any permission to use Screenly and Screenly shall no longer store, transmit or display to the benefit or use of Customer, any Customer data, content or assets otherwise except that Screenly may continue to store Customer data as required and allowed for Screenly’s own internal use as detailed by the TOS and Privacy Policy. Upon termination the obligation to return and/or discontinue storage or use of Customer date shall not extend to data held or stored by any third parties and Screenly shall bear no responsibility of any kind from such use/storage as may arise.

**10.2** In no event shall termination actively occur during a period which the requirements of termination would disrupt Screenly’s secure transfer and storage of data and/or its provision of services to Customers under the TOS; in such an event, where termination is requested and/or mandated, it shall be instituted at the earliest reasonable convenience following such period where transfer, storage and/or service might otherwise be compromised.

**10.3** Either party may terminate these TOS at any time by providing the other party with at least forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice of termination, but so long as Customer is using or otherwise accessing Screenly or allowing the same, Customer shall be subject to these TOS and they shall endure. Early termination does not void contractual payment obligations.

**10.4** A party may terminate these TOS immediately by written notice if i) the other party ceases or threatens to cease to carry on business as a going concern; or ii) the other party becomes or is reasonably likely to become subject to voluntary or involuntary proceedings in bankruptcy or liquidation; or iii) a receiver or similar officer is appointed with respect to the whole or a substantial part of the other party’s assets; or iv) an event similar to any of the foregoing occurs under any applicable law.

**10.5** If a party breaches any of the provisions of these TOS, the non-breaching party may terminate these TOS as follows: a) immediately upon providing written notice to the breaching party if the breach is not capable of being cured, and b) thirty (30) days after providing written notice to the breaching party if the breaching party fails to cure such breach within such thirty (30) day period.

**10.6** In addition to the aforementioned, Screenly may terminate the TOS immediately upon written notice in the event that Customer is in breach of any portion of this agreement.

**10.7** Upon termination or expiration of the TOS, a) Screenly reserves the right to cease all further delivery/execution/transfer of Product or Services, b) all outstanding invoices immediately become due and payable by electronic transfer or certified or cashier’s check, and c) all rights and licenses of Customer under the TOS shall terminate. If Screenly agrees to complete delivery/execution/transfer of any further Products or Services due against any existing Purchase Orders then Customer shall pay for such Products or Services in advance by electronic transfer or certified or cashier’s check.

**10.8** In the event of termination of the TOS for any reason, Customer shall have no rights to damages or indemnification of any nature related to such termination (but not limiting any claim for damages it might have on account of Screenly’s breach of the TOS, even if the breach gave rise to termination, such liability being governed by and subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in these TOS), specifically including no rights to damages or indemnification for other commitments in connection with the business and good will of Customer or indemnities for any termination of or impact upon a business relationship. Screenly has no notice of any contractual or business relationship of Customer as any result of or related to Screenly unless expressly indicating in a writing signed by Screenly, and has no notice or ability to predict damages of any kind which might arise from the same.

**10.9** In the event that, following the expiration or termination of the TOS, Customer places Purchase Orders and Screenly accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such Purchase Orders shall be governed by the TOS notwithstanding the earlier expiration or termination of the TOS.

d) Customer, its owner(s), principals, directors and officers have not been formally charged with, convicted of, or plead guilty to, any offense involving fraud or corruption.

f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Screenly may suspend performance or terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if Customer breaches any of the representations and warranties set forth in this section.

This limit of liability for Products and Services is cumulative and not per-incident (i.e., the existence of two or more claims will not enlarge this limit).

**12.2** Nothing in these TOS shall limit the liability of Screenly, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and suppliers to Customer for Screenly’s liability arising from fraudulent misrepresentation, or any liability of Screenly which cannot be excluded under applicable law.

Except for the obligation to pay monies due and owing, neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance due to events outside the defaulting party’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, earthquakes, labor disputes, industry-wide shortages of supplies, actions of governmental entities, riots, war, terrorism, fire, epidemics, internet viruses, or delays of common carriers or other circumstances beyond its reasonable control. The obligations and rights of the defaulting party shall be extended for a period equal to the period during which such event prevented such party’s performance.

## 22. LOSS OF ASSETS

INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY LIMITATIONS DISCUSSED AT SECTION 12 (TWELVE), SCREENLY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO ANY ASSETS DURING CUSTOMER’S USE OR ACCESSING OF SCREENLY OR AT ANY TIME BEFORE OR AFTER. SCREENLY MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE THE ASSETS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND WILL ABIDE BY ALL TERMS STATED IN THE PRIVACY POLICY BUT IN CERTAIN CASES CONNECTION ISSUES WITH SERVERS, STORAGE SOURCES, INTERMEDIATE TRANSMITTERS, NODES AND OTHER DEVICES, SOURCES OR DESTINATIONS NOT AFFILIATED WITH SCREENLY CAN CAUSE SOME ASSETS TO BE LOST AND OR DAMAGED OR OTHERWISE IMPACTED IN TRANSFER, UPLOAD AND/OR DISPLAY; THIS LOSS CAN BE UNAVOIDABLE AND SCREENLY DOES NOT BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS SUCH AS THIS OR OF A SIMILAR NATURE.

## 23. REMOTE SERVICE BAN

Included in the liability limitations discussed at Section 12, Screenly shall not be liable or responsible for any ban upon or termination of service from any source/service/system not affiliated with Screenly as any result of Customer’s use of Screenly. Customer is strongly advised to review the use policies of Customer’s servers, service providers and any other system or service which Customer may utilize in using and/or accessing Screenly (including Raspberry Pi), prior to using Screenly.

## 24. NO WAIVER

The waiver by either party of any right provided under the TOS shall not constitute a subsequent or continuing waiver of such right or of any other right under these TOS. No waiver of any kind by Screenly is implied by these TOS and no waiver by Screenly shall be effective or construed unless such is made expressly.

## 25. ASSIGNMENT

Neither the TOS nor any rights or obligations under the TOS shall be assigned by Customer without the Screenly’s prior written consent. Any attempted unauthorized assignment shall be void and of no effect. Screenly may assign the TOS and any right or obligation under it without Customer’s approval, to any Affiliate or any party who becomes an owner of 51% or more of the business assets constituting either Screenly and/or Screenly. Notwithstanding any assignment by Customer, Customer shall remain liable for the payment of all amounts due under the TOS.

## 26. SEVERABILITY

In the event that part of or one or more terms of the TOS become or are declared to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, each such part or term shall be null and void. All remaining terms of the TOS shall remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this paragraph is invoked and, as a result, the value of the TOS is materially impaired for either party, as determined by such party in its sole discretion, then the affected party may terminate these TOS by written notice with immediate effect to the other.

## 27. REVISIONS

The TOS may be revised from time to time by Screenly without approval of or notice to Customer. Customer is hereby advised to that any continued use of Screenly upon a revision of the TOS shall constitute Customer’s acceptance of any revisions to the TOS. Customer is therefore advised to periodically review the TOS so that Customer may be well informed of any changes; Customer is particularly urged to review the TOS prior to each time Customer utilizes Screenly for a new asset upload/display or interfacing with a new node.

## 28. NO AGENCY

The TOS do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or franchise relationship. No employee of either party shall be or become, or shall be deemed to be or become, an employee or agent of the other party by virtue of the existence or implementation of these TOS. Neither party shall assume or create any obligation of any nature whatsoever on behalf of the other party or bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.

## 29. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

The TOS constitute the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter of the TOS and replace any prior oral or written communications between the parties, all of which are excluded. There are no conditions, understandings, agreements, representations or warranties, expressed or implied, that are not specified herein.
